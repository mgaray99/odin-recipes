    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons, plain flour</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 lbs. venison meat, sliced into 1-inch chunks</li>
        <li>4 tbsp. olive oil, divided in 2</li>
        <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
        <li>2 celery sticks, chopped</li>
        <li>6 tbsp. blueberries</li>
        <li>2 Rosemary twigs</li>
        <li>3 cups beef stock</li>
        <li>6 shiitake or Porcini mushrooms, dried, pre-soaked in ½ cup boiling water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>4 small new potatoes, cubed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the flour with the salt and pepper and then add the venison chunks. 
            <br>Mix until the meat is coated evenly.</li>
        <li>In a large non-stick pan (with lid), heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil on high heat, then cook the venison chunks until they turn brown. 
            <br>Remove the meat from the pan and put to one side.</li>
        <li>Add another 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the same pan before adding the carrots, onions, garlic, celery, and blueberries. 
            <br>Cook these for 5 minutes, occasionally stirring with a wooden spoon, before finally adding one rosemary twig and a quarter-cup of beef stock.</li>
        <li>Keeping the pan covered, cook for another 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover and return the browned venison meat to the pan, along with the remaining rosemary twig, before cooking for an additional 5-8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir and add 2 cups of beef stock along with mushrooms (include the water they've been soaking in). 
            <br>You can also add the Worcestershire sauce at this point.</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil before turning the heat to low, allowing the stew to simmer.</li>
        <li>Add your cubed potatoes and slow-cook for at least 1 hour, adding the remaining beef stock if necessary, cooking until the meat and the vegetables are tender. 
            <br>Add fresh rosemary leaves and serve straightaway. 
            <br>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
