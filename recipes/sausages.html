    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a coarse, country-style wild boar sausage recipe that highlights the flavor of the boar. 
        <br>It uses only a few herbs for flavoring, which allows the taste of the meat to come through.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 pounds wild hog meat</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds pork shoulder (make sure it's fatty)</li>
        <li>25 grams sugar</li>
        <li>34 grams kosher or sea salt</li>
        <li>10 grams garlic powder</li>
        <li>10 grams dried thyme</li>
        <li>15 grams minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>10 grams minced fresh sage</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ice water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white wine</li>
        <li>hog casings</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chill the meat until it is almost frozen by putting it in the freezer for an hour or so. 
            <br>Take out some hog casings and set in a bowl of very warm water.</li>
        <li>Chop meat and fat into 1 inch chunks. 
            <br>Combine the sugar, salt, garlic and herbs with the meat, mix well with your hands and let it rest in the fridge for about an hour, or up to overnight. 
            <br>Grind through your meat grinder (you can use a food processor in a pinch, but you will not get a fine texture) using the coarse die, anywhere from 6.5 mm to 8 mm. 
            <br>If your room is warmer than 69Â°F, set the bowl for the ground meat into another bowl of ice to keep it cold.</li>
        <li>Add the wine and water, then mix thoroughly either using a Kitchenaid on low for 60 to 90 seconds or with your (very clean) hands. 
            <br>This is important to get the sausage to bind properly. 
            <br>Once it is mixed well, put it back in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Stuff the sausage into the casings all at once. 
            <br>Twist off links by pinching the sausage down and twisting and spinning it, first in one direction, and then with the next link, the other direction. 
            <br>Or you could tie them off with butcher's string.</li>
        <li>Hang the sausages in a cool place for a few hours (the colder it is, the longer you can hang them). 
            <br>If it is warm out, hang for one hour. 
            <br>Once they have dried a bit, put in the fridge until needed. 
            <br>They will keep for at least a week in the fridge.</li>
        <li>If you are freezing the sausages, wait a day before doing so. 
            <br>This will tighten up the sausages and help them keep their shape in the deep-freeze.</li>
    </ol>
